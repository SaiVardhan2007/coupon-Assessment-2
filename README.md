A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application for coupon assessment.

## Project Structure

```
coupon_Assessment2/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/          # React frontend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/          # Node.js backend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json     # Root package.json for managing both client and server
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        # This file
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd coupon_Assessment2
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

   Or install individually:
   ```bash
   # Install server dependencies
   npm run install-server
   
   # Install client dependencies (after creating React app)
   npm run install-client
   ```

### Environment Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory and update the `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```bash
   cd server
   cp .env.example .env  # If you have an example file
   ```

2. Update the environment variables in `server/.env`:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET`: A secure secret for JWT tokens
   - `PORT`: Server port (default: 5000)

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode

To run both client and server concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev
```

To run individually:
```bash
# Run server only
npm run server

# Run client only (after React app is created)
npm run client
```

#### Production Mode

```bash
# Build the client
npm run build

# Start the server
npm start
```

## Server Structure

The server is organized with the following structure:

- `index.js` - Main server entry point
- `models/` - MongoDB schemas and models
- `routes/` - API route definitions
- `controllers/` - Route handlers and business logic
- `middleware/` - Custom middleware functions
- `.env` - Environment variables

## Next Steps

1. **‚úÖ React App Created**: Vite-based React application with Tailwind CSS
2. **‚úÖ Authentication System**: Complete login/signup with JWT and MongoDB
3. **‚úÖ Routing Setup**: React Router with protected routes and auth context
4. **Start Development**: Both frontend and backend are ready for feature development
